# 🏁 Optimized Race Registration Form 🏁 

This project focuses on improving a race registration form by restructuring and optimizing the user experience. The initial form provided by the instructor was poorly structured, containing usability issues and redundant fields, which have been streamlined for clarity and efficiency.

## Project Goal
The goal was to redesign an inefficient registration form, making it more user-friendly, reducing unnecessary fields, and ensuring a smooth registration process.

## Key Improvements
- Simplified the form layout for better readability.
- Ensured all essential fields are clearly labeled.
- Used appropriate input types for better validation (e.g., date, email, phone number).
- Grouped related fields logically.
- Improved accessibility by optimizing labels and input structure.
